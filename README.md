## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Raspberry Pi (tested on Pi 5)
- USB webcam (1080p recommended)
- Optional: GPIO hardware (button, LEDs, speaker)

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd raspberry-pi-video-recorder
   ```

2. **Configure the system:**

   a. Copy and edit the main configuration file:
   ```bash
   cp config/settings.py config/settings.py.local  # Optional: keep custom config separate
   ```

   b. Edit `config/settings.py` to customize:
   - GPIO pin assignments
   - Recording duration and video quality
   - Storage paths and retention policies
   - Video title prefix (change from generic "Video Session" to your domain)

   c. Setup YouTube authentication:
   ```bash
   # Copy the .env template
   cp .env.example .env

   # Edit .env and set the paths (defaults should work):
   YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET_PATH=credentials/client_secret.json
   YOUTUBE_TOKEN_PATH=credentials/token.json
   YOUTUBE_PLAYLIST_ID=your_playlist_id_here  # Optional
   ```

   d. Authenticate with YouTube (one-time setup):
   ```bash
   # Download client_secret.json from Google Cloud Console
   # Place it in credentials/client_secret.json

   # Run authentication setup (opens browser)
   python setup_youtube_auth.py

   # This creates credentials/token.json for automatic uploads
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Virtual environment** will be automatically configured if using VS Code

## Configuration Guide

### üìã Centralized Configuration

**ALL configuration lives in `config/settings.py`** - this is your single source of truth.

#### What You Can Configure:

**Hardware:**
- GPIO pin assignments (button, LEDs)
- Audio/TTS settings (rate, volume, speaker device)

**Recording:**
- Video resolution, FPS, codec settings
- Recording durations (default, extension, maximum)
- Camera device path

**Storage:**
- Storage base path and directory structure
- Space thresholds and retention policies
- Upload retry configuration
- Auto-cleanup settings

**Upload:**
- Video title prefix (customize for your domain!)
- Default tags and privacy settings
- YouTube category
- Upload timeout and chunk size

#### Example Customization:

```python
# config/settings.py

# Change this to match your use case
SESSION_TITLE_PREFIX = "Training Session"  # "Security Footage", "Event Recording", etc.
DEFAULT_VIDEO_TAGS = ["training", "gym", "workout"]  # Customize for your domain

# Adjust recording quality
VIDEO_WIDTH = 1920
VIDEO_HEIGHT = 1080
VIDEO_FPS = 30

# Storage retention
UPLOADED_RETENTION_DAYS = 14  # Keep videos for 2 weeks
MAX_UPLOADED_VIDEOS = 50
```

### üîê Secrets Management

**NEVER commit credentials to version control!**

This project uses **file-based OAuth** for YouTube uploads:

1. **Download credentials from Google Cloud Console**:
   - Create a project and enable YouTube Data API v3
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop app type)
   - Download `client_secret.json`
   - Place in `credentials/client_secret.json`

2. **Authenticate once** (creates token.json):
   ```bash
   python setup_youtube_auth.py
   ```
   This opens a browser for you to grant permissions. The token is saved and refreshed automatically.

3. **Configure .env** (paths to credential files):
   ```bash
   # .env (NEVER commit this file!)
   YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET_PATH=credentials/client_secret.json
   YOUTUBE_TOKEN_PATH=credentials/token.json
   YOUTUBE_PLAYLIST_ID=your_playlist_id  # Optional
   ```

The `credentials/` directory is already in `.gitignore` - your secrets are safe!

## Domain-Agnostic Design

This system is intentionally **generic** - no hardcoded business logic. To adapt it for your use case:

1. **Change video titles**: Edit `SESSION_TITLE_PREFIX` in `config/settings.py`
2. **Customize tags**: Modify `DEFAULT_VIDEO_TAGS` for your domain
3. **Adjust voice prompts**: Edit `AUDIO_MESSAGE_TEXTS` in `hardware/constants.py`
4. **Configure retention**: Set `UPLOADED_RETENTION_DAYS` based on your needs

### Example Use Cases:
- **Sports Training**: "Training Session 2025-01-15 14:30"
- **Security Camera**: "Security Recording 2025-01-15 14:30"
- **Dance Studio**: "Class Recording 2025-01-15 14:30"
- **Lecture Recording**: "Lecture 2025-01-15 14:30"

Simply change one config value and the entire system adapts!

### Development Tools

This project uses the following tools for code quality:

- **Ruff**: Modern, fast Python linter and formatter
- **Black**: Code formatter for consistent style
- **isort**: Import statement organizer
- **mypy**: Static type checker

#### Manual Linting and Formatting

Run all linting and formatting tools:
```bash
./lint.sh
```

Or run individual tools:
```bash
# Linting with Ruff
.venv/bin/ruff check . --fix

# Format imports
.venv/bin/isort .

# Format code with Black
.venv/bin/black .

# Type checking
.venv/bin/mypy . --ignore-missing-imports
```

### VS Code Configuration

The project includes VS Code settings that will:
- Automatically format Python files on save
- Use the correct Python interpreter from the virtual environment
- Show linting errors inline
- Organize imports automatically

GPIO_LED_ORANGE = 16    # Orange LED (processing)
GPIO_LED_RED = 20       # Red LED (error)
```

## System Behavior

### Recording Workflow

- System Ready: Green LED solid, "System ready" voice prompt
- Start Recording: Single button press ‚Üí Green LED blinking, "Recording started"
- Extension: Double button press during recording ‚Üí "5 minutes added"
- Warning: At 9 minutes ‚Üí "One minute remaining, press button twice to extend"
- Stop Recording: Single button press ‚Üí Orange LED, "Recording complete, uploading"
- Ready: Background upload complete ‚Üí Green LED, "Ready for next recording"

### Error Handling

- Storage Full: Red LED, "Memory full" voice prompt
- Camera Error: Red LED, "Camera error" voice prompt
- Network Down: Red LED, "Network disconnected" voice prompt
- Recovery: Single button press in error state attempts recovery

### Audio Feedback Messages

- System startup: "System ready"
- Recording start: "Recording started"
- 9-minute warning: "One minute remaining, press button twice to extend"
- Extension confirmed: "5 minutes added, recording continues"
- Recording stop: "Recording complete, uploading"
- Ready state: "Ready for next recording"
- Upload complete: "Upload successful"
- Error states: "Memory full" / "Network disconnected" / "Camera error"

## Key Design Principles

- State-Driven: All behavior controlled by central state machine
- Non-Blocking: Background operations don't interfere with recording
- Fault-Tolerant: Comprehensive error handling with recovery
- Modular: Each component independently testable
- Extensible: Easy to add features (multiple cameras, etc.)
